I think I understand the basics of Git. My one hang up is that this is not my school account, so this repository will not show up when I long into the cobra server.
I tried to log in with my cobra.cs.mercer.edu account, but that only works on anvil/GitLab, not GitHub, so I'm not sure how to connect the two accounts.

Other than that, I think I got it!
